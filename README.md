1. Install ScaffoldETH following the instruction from [ScaffoldETH](https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/scaffold-eth/getting-started/installation)
2. Git clone this repo; replace the directory "package" which is the main project directory

## Accessing
---
Go into `/package/`;

`yarn chain` to start the local network; 

`yarn deploy` to deploy the contracts with additional workflow defined in `/package/hardhat/deploy/*`; 

`yarn start` to bring up a local frontend at port 3000
## Unit Tests:
---
Run `yarn test` that runs the test scripts form `/package/hardhat/test/myTest.js`

## Introduction:
---
OBP = Online Betting Protocol for everyone!
There are billions of dollar being gambled on sport&Esport events every year. Yet people can hardly find a fair, decentralised and customized betting place for events they would like to bet. Result of sport events are exposed to everyone; rather than creating an oracle network when only whitelisted operator can run, OBP allows everyone to be a bettor, refereee, event operator, as well as a court member for keeping OBP as a fair place!


### OBPToken:
---
`OBPToken` is an ERC20 token that serves 3 functions:
1. Stake at court for getting **1%** of all total fee generated in all events deployed in the protocol.
2. Stakers are eligible to vote on cases where an refereee is sued for cheating/injecting wrong result for an event.
3. OBPToken is accepted as a betting token.


### OBPMain:
---
`OBPMain` is the hub of OBP protocols. It allows anyone to deploy a bettingOperator and a referee respectively.
This contracts:
1. Records all official referee(s) and betting operator(s) that are deployed through the official deployers.
2. Deploy Referee or Operator
3. Add/remove supported tokens for betting
4. Record the official court contract.


### BettingOperatorDeployer:
---
`BettingOperatorDeployer` deploys a bettingOperator. It should be only called indirectly through the OBPMain contracts so the deployed operator is registered in the OBPMain contract.


### BettingOperator
---
A `bettingOperator` contains a roothash when deployed, that is a hash of all its event logic and Pool Ids. A BettingOpeartor start to take bet once
it has received a bounding of OBP from a registered Referee. Then anyone can place bet on a Pool based on its Ids. Payout is claimable once the Referee closes the Pool and inject payout results. A betting operator takes 1% of total bet fee.


### RefereeDeployer:
---
`RefereeDeployer` deploys a referee. It should be only called indirectly through the OBPMain contracts so the deployed referee is registered in the OBPMain contract.


### Referee
---
A `Referee` takes the responsibility to bounds its staked OBP for betting Operator(s) to ensure it is injecting the precise payout result,
in return for **3%** of the total betting fee received in the bettingOperator.
### CourtProxy:
---
`CourtProxy` is an upgradable proxy that performs the court duty. It allows
1. staking for getting **1%** of total bet fee.
2. voting
3. upgradeability
4. consifacte staked OBP from a referee if its result is deemed corrupt.


### CourtLib(V1)
---
`CourtLib` is the logic library that handles the delegatd call from CourtProxy.
